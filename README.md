# Haskell for TypeScript Developers

## Foreword

I'm Brooklyn Zelenka, the author of this guide and CTO and co-founder at [Fission](https://fission.codes). You can find many of my presentations and keynotes on [Notist](https://noti.st/expede), and on most online spaces as **@expede**, including [Twitter](https://twitter.com/expede) and [Github](https://github.com/expede).

> _â€” Motto of the Haskell Core Dev Team_

Haskell was explicitly designed to be an _influential_ language; to get concepts used by other languages. To this end it has been extraordinarily successful. The JavaScript ecosystem has increasingly to borrowed concepts, patterns, and features from the ML-family of languages over the past few years.

As someone who is fairly associated with functional programming, and having taught a number of functional languages and techniques to many teams over the past several years, I've been increasingly called on to teach _specifically Haskell_ to curious developers. If you're looking for an excellent introductory book with practice problems and the like, I recommend [Haskell from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/). However, not every team has the time to go through a 1000+ page book, and need to get up and running in production code quickly by leveraging existing experience with other languages.

In this guide, you will get a working understanding of how to work in a 2019 industry-style web project by drawing on your existing experience with TypeScript

This guide is designed to onboard developers at [Fission](https://fission.codes). We are opinionated about how we do Haskell, and this guide is not meant as a guide to "all things Haskell"
