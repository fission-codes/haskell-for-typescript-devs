# Chapter Four: Database

## The Legend of Selda

Haskell has many database libraries, and there's a recent trend in leveraging the type system to giving increasingly safe database access. Despite the goofy name, [Selda](https://selda.link/) \(the website is literally `selda.link`😆⚔️\) is a very robust database DSL, and works equally well for PostgreSQL or SQLite.

We may later switch to [Beam](https://tathougies.github.io/beam/), which is more feature rich, has generally faster compilation, and has a clearer tutorial. We switched to Selda due to a bug in a dependency, which has since been fixed.
